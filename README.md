## Conways Game of Life


#### 1. Intro 
This is my first real C project and I thought that the game of life was a fun little excercise to test my C skills and really get a grasp of the concepts in real projects.
I used SDL because it was the simplest graphics library and doesn't have a steep learning curve. It didn't take long and was entertaining since this was my first time creating any kind
of graphics application/game

#### 2. Controls
1. You can click the cells that you want to activate or deactivate
2. To go to the next epoch press `Space`
3. Press the start and stop button in the corner to let the game run
4. Press `r` to clear the screen of all existing cells
5. Quit, of course, by closing the application

#### 3. Example

</p>

#### 4. Installation
1. clone this repo
2. run the `game_of_life` binary
3. This code was only tested on MacOs, so I can't guarantee that it works on other platforms
